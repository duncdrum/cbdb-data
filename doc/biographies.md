### biog:kin 

9 basic categories of kinship Source: CBDB Manual p 13f
none of these is symmetrical hence there is no need for mutuality checks as in biog:asso
'e' Ego (the person whose kinship is being explored) 
'F' Father
'M' Mother
'B' Brother
'Z' Sister
'S' Son
'D' Daughter
'H' Husband
'W' Wife
'C' Concubine

'+' Older (e.g. older brother B+, 兄)
'-' Younger (e.g. younger sister 妹)
'*' Adopted heir ( as in S*, adopted son)
'°' Adopted
'!' Bastard
'^' Step- (as in S^ step-son)
'½'  half- (as in Z½ , half-sister)
'~' Nominal (as in M~ , legitimate wife as nominal mother to children of concubine)
'%' Promised husband or wife (marriage not completed at time of record)
'y' Youngest (e.g., Sy is the youngest known son)
'1' Numbers distinguish sequence (e.g., S1, S2 for first and second sons; W1, W2 for the first and the successor wives)
'n' precise generation unknown
'G-#', 'G+#' lineal ancestor (–) or descendant (+) of # generation №
'G-n', 'G+n', 'Gn' lineal kin of an unknown earlier generation (G-n), or unknown later generation (G+n), or unknown generation (Gn)
'G-#B', 'BG+#' a brother of a lineal ancestor of # generation; a brother’s lineal descendant of # generation
'K', 'K-#', 'K+#', 'Kn' Lineage kin, of the same, earlier (–), later (+) or unknown (n) generation. CBDB uses “lineage kin” for cases where kinship is attested but the exact relationship is not known. Lineage kin are presumably not lineal (direct descent) kin.
'K–', 'K+' Lineage kin of the same generation, younger (-) or elder (+).
'P', 'P-#', 'P+#', 'Pn' Kin related via father’s sisters or mother’s siblings, of the same, earlier (–), later (+) or unknown (n) generation. Signified by the term biao (表) in Chinese. (CBDB uses these codes only when the exact relationship is not known). 
'P–', 'P+' Kin related via father's sisters or mother's siblings, of the same generation, younger (-) or elder (+).
'A' Affine/Affinal kin, kin by marriage
