# README

CBDB's source files as xml go here. Due to size limitations this is not part of the Github repo,
but can be added from the release [page](https://github.com/duncdrum/cbdb-data/releases).  

You can also download the SQLite file used to generate the export
[here](https://hu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/hongsuwang_fas_harvard_edu/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?docid=07ade27f1bf524247b8b2295d04111975&authkey=AaFG1lZv0b8DCjUbfUG8uIU)
to add your own copy  of cbdb's data.

The app works 100% with the tei files, hence the sources are omitted from the standard package. Adding the source files is only necessary when developing the conversion scheme.
