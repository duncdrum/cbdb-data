    <note>Hui(1) Junmin [14888] Yuan(1) Yueyou's [14881] wife was a Changzhou native buried in Yixing. According to her funerary inscription, her father was a Hui(1) Cui (not in dataset), who earned the jinshi. The Pinling zhi jinshi list records no such person. There are no other Yixing Hui(1) but the descendants of Hui(1) Zhi [14886] (but see below for Jiangyin Hui(1)) and I am therefore identifying Junmin as the uncle-in-law of Yuan(1) Yueyou, which establishes an almost certain affinal link between these lineages although the generation may be wrong. See documentation for Junmin's son, Zhe [14893]. Yuan(1) Yueyou composed a stele inscription for a Hui(1) Buzhi (zi), who has the same generational zi as Zhe's son, Duanfang [14894], which may further confirm the link between the two lineages. However, Hui(1) Chou (q.v.), a Jiangyin county resident also uses the same generational indicator in his zi, which probably indicates that these two lineages, residents in contiguous counties, were related. This would seem to be confirmed by the fact that Chou's maternal grandmother, born Jiang(3), was a daughter of a member of the family (jian? of Jiang(3) Fei [10456], a chief minister in 1168 and a Changzhou, Yinxing county resident. Chou's affinal kin included three state council members of previous generations--all wife-givers to the Jiangyin Hui(1)! I am identifying Chou as a third cousin of Dafang, and the Yixing Hui(1) as jia 'a' and the Jiangyin Hui(1) as jia 'b.'</note>
