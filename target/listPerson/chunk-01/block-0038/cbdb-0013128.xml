    <note>Hu(1) B [13128] Quan's [10565] and Dengchen's [13134] ancestor moved to Jian-s from Jinling during the disturbances of Five Dynasties, probably when Yang(2) Xingmi [4044] established the brief kingdom of Wu. According to Hu(1) Quan's funerary inscription for his grandmother, born Zhang (WJ, 30.6a-7a), the Hu(1) of Luling (i.e. Jian-s) were a great lineage 'dazu' or 'zhuzu' [confirmed in many other funerary inscriptions]) that presented several ten's of candidates for every sitting of the exams and that many were successful. This suggests that all Jian-s Hu(1) were probably descended from this common ancestor. However, the descendants of Quan's great grandfather, Lian [13135], and Dengchen's father, Liang [13130], both sons of Fu [13131] [see Lian's documentation] seem to account for the most prominent and are classed respectively as b and a branches of the lineage since the lineage segmented with Lian and Liang. Liang seems to be the older brother, and the prominance of the Jian Hu(1) seems to begin after the marriage of Dengchen to Ouyang(1) Yanshou's [12143] daughter.  Gongchen's [13137] son, Quan(2) [13138] (who adopted Fu as heir), was Quan's grandfather Kai(2)'s [13136] lineage nephew. Gongchen was the third son of Lingyi [820], a Kaifeng resident. Liang, Dengchen's father was of the same generation as Kai and Gongchen, and also held office, possibly through influence of his son's father-in-law's family (The Jian-s, Changsha Ouyang). It is also possible that these Hu are kin with the Hongzhou Hu.</note>
