    <note>Lu(9) Mengqi [13093] Based on XTS, 75A.52b and Lu(9) Mengzheng's [8101] and Lu(9) Yijian's [8100] funerary inscriptions, the evidence suggests the following pattern of migration. The Dongping Lu(9) ancestor setttled in Shouzhou, which was a part of Dongping jun. Mengqi was Bingbu shilang, Beijing fu liushou (resident vice-prefect of the Northern Capital) at the end of the Tang and settled in Taiyuan (Taiyuan was the Tang dynasty Beijing). One son, Guitu [13094], moved to Luoyang at the beginning of Song, whereas his brother, Guixiang [13096], held a post in Shouzhou, Shouchun (which happened to be the ancestral home of the Dongping Lu(9)) and settled here. His three sons, Mengheng [7054], Mengsun [13097], and Mengzhou [13098] apparently moved to Kaifeng (Mengheng's son Yijian documented as moving to Kaifeng, but probably his father migrated with son, since Mengsun's daughter designated as a Kaifeng resident). I record Mengheng as having moved Kaifeng from Shouchun and identify his two younger brothers, Mengsun and Mengzhou, as Kaifeng residents and all their descendants (before other moves) are designated as Kaifeng residents, whereas all descendants of Mengzheng are designated as Luoyang residents.</note>
