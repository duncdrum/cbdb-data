    <note>Sheng(1) Guanzhong [13532] See documentation for son-in-law, Chao(2) Yuezhi [3029]. There are three Sheng(1) x+zhong mingzi with biographical data in CBD, 4, 2930. There is no indication, besides a common generational name, that they are either related to Guanzhong or that they are of either Sheng(1) Jing's or Sheng(1) Du's branch of the Sheng lineage. However, Sheng(1) Cizhong [24405] was a Kaifeng resident, migrant address of Jing, grandfather of Sheng(1) Zhongsun [13531], who is identified in CBD as a Yuhang resident. Morever, Chao(2) Yuezhi composed the funerary inscription for Sheng(1) Zhongsun's mother, wife of Sheng(1) Zunfu, who was the grandmother of Chao(2) Yuezhi's mother, which would place Guanzhong in the same generation as Yuezhi's father, Chao(2) Duanyan [14]. born Sheng(1) died at the age of 84, which establishes a chronological basis, as well, for assuming that Guanzhong is a cousin of Zhongsun, whose brother's generational names are not completely consistant, and that Guanzhong, Cizhong, Hezhong [24407] and Nanzhong [24406] were all nephews of Zunfu [3743].
