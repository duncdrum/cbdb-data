    <note>Zhao(1) Shitan [10497] The Jiahe zhi, 15.3b, 5b and 9a have a Shitan as father of Buyu [386] and Buyu as father of Shanyi [14774] and Shanpeng [14775]. In SS, 229.17b, Shanpeng and Shanyi are listed as brothers (since the mingzi are strange, there can be no coincidence here), but as sons of a Buwu (not in dataset) and grandsons of a Shiyi (not in dataset). Shitan is the son #1 of Zhongsheng(?) [14777], #2 son of Zonghan [14776] and elder brother of Shiyi. A Buyu, who was childless, is the #3 son of Shijun [16012] and grandson of Zhongquan(2) [16011]. I am assuming that there is an adoption here, and that Shanpeng or Shanyi became the adopted son of Buyu and that Shitan, despite sons and numerous grandsons in the geneaogical tables, was either the adopted father of Buyu or a lineage uncle of Buyu and mistakenly identified in the Jiahe zhi as a father. I am, therefore, going to begin this lineage branch of the imperial clan with Shijun, who we will assume died in Kaifeng and Shitan, who moved to Haiyan (this makes sense since Shijun was the son-in-law of Shiqi(1) Pian [16010], who had kin in Suzhou). I will record Buyu as the lineage nephew of Shitan and son #3 of Shijun and leave Shanpeng and Shanyi as sons of Buyu.</note>
