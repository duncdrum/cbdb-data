    <note>Ge(2) Lizhang [7262] Shengzhong's [7263] # 3 son, who moved from Zhenjiang, Danyang xian to Suzhou where a branch of the lineage was established (He is not listed in Shengzhong's record of conduct as a son, but must be the number 3 son listed in the record of conduct as Zhuo since YLDD, 2367.12b lists him as a son of Shengzhong. This is a good example of lineage segmentation, since Lizhang's sons all have generational names different from those of Lifang's and Lizhong's sons. His brother Lifang's [3462] sons, Bi 3463], Fu [3460], and Tan [3464], moved to Huzhou and established a Wuxing branch of the lineage. His cousin Lizhong seems to have moved to Kaifeng (where he failed in the exams), bcause his son, Tai [14094] (or Shao), is listed as a Kaifeng jinshi in the 1148 exam list and as a Huzhou Guian jinshi in the Zhejiang TZ list. The root lineage seems to have declined as a prominent presence in Changzhou, Jiangyin xian--there are few Jiangyin Ge(2) recorded as jinshi after Lifang's degree in 1138 when the move had already taken place. During the Northern Song, there were at least nineteen Jiayin Ge(2) jinshi. Over the same period, there were no more than a half a dozen Ge(2) jinshi reported for all the other counties of the Lower Yangzi (Zhejiang, Southern Jiangsu, and Southern Anhui). After the respective moves, the Danyang Ge(2) jinshi began with Shengzhong [7263] in 1097 and continued with at least three more between then and 1217. The first of the Wuxing Ge(2) jinshi appeared in 1138 when Lifang, who was also recorded as a Huzhou jinshi, received the degree. There were three Suzhou Ge(2) degree-holders between 1190, when Lizhang's son was awarded the jinshi and 1255. Zhang(1) Pan [7160] was Lizhang's maternal grandfather.
