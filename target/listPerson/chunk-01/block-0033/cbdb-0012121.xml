    <note>Wang Jing[12121] Zhou(1) Bida's [7197] maternal grandfather. His grandfather, Cha [12120], moved from Bozhou, Boping xian to Xiangzhou, Anyang xian. See Zhou Bida's funerary inscription for his daughter, Zhou Lijian's [12131] wife (Zhou Bida, WJ, 36.1a-7a.) In Zhou Bida's funerary inscription for Wang Tao [3980] (Zhou Bida, WJ, 29.19a-26b), he traces the ancestry to Wang Ba [12116] of the early Eastern Han and first ancestor of the Taiyuan Wang to move to Taiyuan. During the Five dynasties an ancestor, probably Yongxi's [12122] unnamed father, M [12122], moved from Bozhou, Boping county to Anyang. Yongxi established this branch (b) of the lineage (qijia) by passing the mingjing examination. The (b) branch seems to have been slightly more successful than the (a) branch, which initially remained in Boping--Yongxi's son, Yue [12126], held office and had a funerary inscription drafted by Zhao Shimin [3207] and Yue's son, Dongxun [12127] was jinshi in 1046, died at the age of 82 and his funerary inscription was composed by Sheng Tao [12124], resident of Zhou Bida's ancestral home, Zhengzhou, Guancheng county. Dongxun's grandson, Tao, was buried in Jizhou, Jishui, Nanshan, Dangui xiang [for location see Wang Xiangzhi, Yudi jisheng, 31.4a] and Zhou Bida's in-laws of Wang branch (a) probably moved here as well. I am assuming that Jing's uncle, Hou [22216], made the move (see documentation for Hou's son, Jue [22218]). The conclusion I draw is that Yongxi represents a cadet branch of Wang L's [12118] lineage that moved to Anyang. Subsequently, a branch of the senior branch (a) represented by Cha moved to Anyang. Both Anyang Wang moved to Jizhou to join their affinal kin, the Guancheng Zhou, when Zhou Shen [3248], Tongpan of Jizhou, stayed here when stranded at the end of the Northern Song (See Lu You, WJ, 38.6a).</note>
