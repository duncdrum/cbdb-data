    <note>Yang(2) Jun [12365] The primary ancestor of branch (b) or the Yuegong branch (fang) of the Zhongshan Yang. His sons Xuan(2) (#1) [12366], Jian [12367] (#3) and Kuan [22509] (#4) appear to have created three subbranches. Xuan(2)'s descendants included three Tang zaixiang. According to SS, 307.13b, the descendants of Jian and Kuan became three new branches (fang [ward, which may refer to three wards of Changan]. Jian's #3 son, Wensheng [22557] (there is a gap in XTS, 71B.45a for the generation of his great grandson, was the 8th generation ancestor of Rushi [22559] and his younger brothers, who became known as the Jinggong fang and were the ancestors of lineage 490, which moved to Hanzhou, Mianzhu county, and 496, which moved to Hangzhou. Jian's #4 son, Wenwei [22571], was the 7th generation ancestor of Ping [22572], Jingzhao yin XTS, 71B.48b) and founder of the Ludao fang. Kuan was the ancestor of Yuling [22436], who, in turn, was the founder of the Xinchang fang and ancestor of a branch that moved to Luoyang (see Yang(2) Xie [2003]) and which was important in Song. I will follow the Song Shi and begin the Jinggong fang with Rushi and his brothers, Yuqing [22560 and Hangong [22565]; the Xinchang fang with Yuling and the Ludao fang with Ping. See XTS, 71B.43a and Renming Da cidian, p. 1277.</note>
