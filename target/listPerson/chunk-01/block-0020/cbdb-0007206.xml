    <note>Zhu(1) Zirong [7206] The Jia(3) and the Peigho Zhu(1) had been intermarried since time of Jia(3) Qing [436]'s grandfather, and when Jia(3) Qing was prefect of Suzhou, the Zhu, after fall of N. Song, became with Zirong the founders of the Kunshan Zhu(1). Since Jia(3) Qing was prefect of Su Zhou during the Shaosheng period and died in office, my guess is that Zirong was the maternal grandson of Qing, i.e. Zirong's father was Jia(3) Qing's son-in-law. Since his youth coincided with the Yuanyou purges, my guess is that this was the initial reason for the Zhu family saying in Kunshan. This also probably dates the initial settlement of the Jiading Jia(3) [Kunshan at this time]. I am also guessing that the Zhu(1) were Kaifeng residents as were the Jia(3).
