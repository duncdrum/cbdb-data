    <note>Shen(3) A [14703] This is the unidentified father of Zhili [14704] and Shouli [14705]. 5th generation descendant, Gao [14711] (q.v), was buried in Kaifeng and, according to his funerary inscription, they were a distinguished surname (zhuxing) of Wuye and later moved to Quzhou. The funerary inscription of his great grandaughter (wife of Guan(1) Jingren [13368] (q.v.), says that the family moved to Chen at beginning of Song. Since Chen and Chenliu are used to refer to Kaifeng, I am assuming that Wuyue is a generic term for the region and that A was a Quxian resident, who moved to Hangzhou and that his sons moved to Kaifeng. The Runan chrononym is indicated in the funerary inscription of Qian(1) Shu [3037], father-in-law of A's grandson, Congji [14706].</note>
