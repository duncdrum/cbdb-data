    <note>Yin(1) A [11855] Dummy ancestor of many of the Song Tang(1), who probably became the Yin of Danyang and Huating in Yuan. His son, B [11849], moved to Zhenjiang and another son, C [11857], probably Wengui's [11856] father, moved to Chi, Guichi county (changed from Qiupu by Yang(2) Xingmi [4044], Ruler of Wudai Wu) in whose administration Wengui served. Wengui's son Chongyi [11858] served as a prime minister of Southern Tang and changed his surname to Tang(1) and mingzi to Yue at begining of Song when given office by Taizu (Zhao(1) Kuangyin) to avoid use of the homonym with the second character in the Song founder's mingzi. Although there are no documented links cited between the Guichi Tang(1) (Yungong [1592] is the only later representative) and the Danyang and Jintan Tang (both branches tracing ancestry to Wudai Yin(1)), it is highly doubtful that this is just coincidence.</note>
