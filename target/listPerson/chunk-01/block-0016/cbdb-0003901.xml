    <note>Zeng(1) Zhun [3901] Jiangxi TZ, 21.19b. See also documentation for son, Ji [1692]. His ancestors were Ganxian residents and one of them moved to Henan, Luoyang. Both father, Ping [17603], and grandfather, Zhi [17602], held office. Zhun is still listed as a Ganxian jinshi, but so was his great grandson Gai [13480] (also listed as a Shanyin jinshi, as was his nephew, An [14928] [identified in CBD as a Ganxian resident] and a great great grandson (or great great grandnephew, Xun(3) [14927] was also listed as both a Ganxian jinshi and a Shanyin jinshi). His son  Ji moved to Shaoxing, Shanyin county from Henan and Kai [13481], who was listed as a Ganxian jinshi in 1103 and elder brother of Ji must have moved since his age at death (71) is recorded and another elder brother, Bi [17600], is also listed as a 1103 jinshi. Another 1103 Ganxian jinshi, Ban [17601], shares the same generational name with Ji, Kai, Bi and Mao [13482] [represented by two elements enveloping a third element] does not have notices in CBD and I am going to assume 1) they he was a son of Zhun and 2) was stranded in the north and therefore remained as a Luoyang resident. Ji's grandnephew, Ji(3) [17604], grandson of Mao (listed as a Ganxian 1100 jinshi), studied with his granduncles Ji and Kai and was also a student of L?Zuqian, who is identified as a cousin of a different surname (zhongbiao), thereby providing further evidence that Mao was a brother of Ji, who was father-in-law of LU(9) Zujian's [7055] father, Daqi [3652]. I am going to assume that Mao was another son of Zhun and that Zhun's grandfather, Zhi, moved to Luoyang and that all Ganxian addresses were anachronistic.</note>
