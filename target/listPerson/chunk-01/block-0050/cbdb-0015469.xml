    <note>Huang(2) Yuhe [15469] See documentation for descendant, Huang(2) Chouruo [15471], and collateral kin's descendant, Huang(2) Xin [845]. Yuhe's great grandson, Cishan [15449], was #1 graduate of the imperial university in 1119, but was placed #4 because he used the taboo characters of his lineage uncle Huang(2) Tingjian's [7111] mingzi. Since Cishan is identified as #1 graduate in other sources, but not in HSSCGY, the story seems accurate. This would make Yuhe the lineage nephew of Yuanji [3422], ancestor of the other three branches of the Dongyang Huang(2), who traced their ancestral residence to Dongyang, ancient name for Wuzhou and later name of one of Wuzhou's counties. According to Liu(2) Kezhuang's [3595] funerary inscription for Yuhe's descendant Chouruo, Yuhe moved to Fengcheng. Cao(1) Yanyue's [10840] funerary inscription for Chouruo's eldest son, Ce [15472], has Ce's 7th generation ancestor moving from Fenning (modern Xiushui) to Fengcheng and both have the family originating in Wuzhou, Jinhua, which confirms the relatonship between this branch of the lineage and that of Huang(2) Tingjian. See Cao Yanyue, WJ, 18.10b. This is an excellant example of both the selectivity and the accuracy of funerary inscriptions in their tracing of the early ancestry of their subject. CHECK (print out this lineage and consolidate notes). Liu Kezhuang, WJ, 142.4b identifies Ma(2) Cun [15490] as the author of Yuhe's funerary inscription and also traces ancestry (9b) to Huang(2) Qiong [15485] (Renming Da cidian, p. 1249) and his father Xiang(2) [15484] (Renming Da cidian, p. 1237) prominent officials during the Latter Han. The Huang(2) do not appear in either the genealogical tables for the NanBei Chao or those for Tang zaixiang; confirmation that independent sources of genealogical information were used by Liu(2) Kezhuang and Cao(1) Yanyue.</note>
