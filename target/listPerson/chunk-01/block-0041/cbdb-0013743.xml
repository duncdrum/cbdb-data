    <note>Zhang(1) Xian(4) [13743] His highest office was county sherrif (wei). According to Zhou(1) Bida's [7197] funerary inscription for his son, Tingjie [7014] (q.v.), the family had lived in the same village (li) for generations. Tingjie's father-in-law, Li(2) Kuan [13748] rose to position as a tongpan. They were also Wuxian natives and Kuan(2)'s father and grandfather also did not hold office (grandfather Ying(5) [13746] was a chushi), although Kuan(2)'s father, Ya [13747], received a posthumous title, which is unusual given the low office of his son. Yet, Tingjie's son-in-laws were from prominent lineages, and both Tinjie and his wife had funerary inscriptions authored by Zhou(1) Bida. Neither Tingjie nor any of his ancestors and sons and grandsons received the jinshi. The best were his #1 son Shengren [13744], juren from Suzhou in 1150, who entered the imperial university, but died young, and Qian(2) [13745] (probably Shenghe, who changed name to Qian(2)), who also entered the taixue.</note>
