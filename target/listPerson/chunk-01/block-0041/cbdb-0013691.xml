    <note>Chen(1) Kefa [13691] See documentation for great grandson, Zhen(3) [13695]. This is a perfect example of segmentation. Kefa was brother of Shiqing [78] and Shize [13690] (same generational names, but different from Kefa). Kefa's grandson, Xuan [13693], has the same generational name as Guan(2) [7128] &amp; his brothers in one source, but in another Xuan has radical 72 instead of 96 and his son, Zhen(3), has the same radical in his mingzi as Guan and, consequently, Zhen(3)'s sons are listed as Guan(2)'s nephews despite the fact that they are his grandnephews. This would seem to suggest that Kefa represented the senior branch of the lineage despite the far greater political distinction of his younger(?) brother, Shiqing, and his descendants, or there may have been a marriage to an imperial princess.</note>
