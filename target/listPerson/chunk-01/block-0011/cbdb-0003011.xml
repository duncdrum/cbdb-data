    <note>Chao(2) Quan [3011] According to Lou Yue's funerary inscription for Chao Gonge [13546], because of Quan's son Jiong's [3012] and grandson Zongque's [8001] distinction, the lineage was granted a residence in Zhaode fang in Kaifeng city (a residence of many, if not all, descendants). He also says that there were no other Chao(2). He notes that afterwards, members of the family moved to places in Kaifeng, Chanzhou, Zhengzhou and Jizhou. I am assuming, on this basis that Di [3021], father of Zongjian and grandfather of Zhongcan [3013] and Zhongyan(2) [13523], was also a son of Quan and that he moved from Kaifeng to Jizhou, Juye. Lou Yue also provides two intermediate ancestors between Cuo [3019] and the Song Chao--Qing of the Northern Wei and Gao of Tang (neither are included in dataset). See other documentation, however, for specific statement that there existed no genealogy to prove these connections. In fact, Chao Buzhi [13], in his funerary inscription for his elder sister (WJ, 65.1a), says that Chao Cuo was executed for his loyalty and therefore his descendants were not illustrious and it was more than 1100 years until Quan's son Jiong made them illustrious. Chao Qing's grandfather, Hui (not in dataset), was prefect of Jizhou and enfeoffed as Yingchuan gong, and Qing inherited this position and was killed by rebels (Renming Da cidian, p. 802). This links the family both to Chao Cuo and to the later Jizhou residents. Gao does not appear in Renming da cidian.[Kinship with Zhongchuo and Zhongdong is not yet checked.與晁仲綽、晁仲冬的親戚關係未考。]</note>
