    <note>Jiang(1) C [15385] According to Li(2) Gou's [3513] funerary inscription for Jiang(1) Hao [15387] (q.v.), who was C's 16th generation grandson, C was the earliest ancestor of the Kaihua Jiang(1) and the lineage could not be traced any earlier. Hu(1) Yin [3402], in his inscription for Hao's great grandson, Gun [4158], writes that the Jiang(1) arrived in Kaihua during the Yongjia troubles at the end of the Western Tsin dynasty and that they were originally from Yan (i.e. Jiyang). These two accounts are not necessarily in conflict. That pre-Kaihua period membership of the lineage was not known does not conflict with knowledge that whoever they were, they came from Shandong. Since the Jiang(1) were a distinguished lineage in NanBei chao (see Zhou Jiayou, 2.257 ff.), the Kaihua Jiang(1) were clearly an undistinguished branch: otherwise, individuals could have been named (failure to do so adds credibility to the genealogy). I conclude that the Kaihua Jiang(1) were descended from an undistinguished branch of the Jiyang Jiang(1).</note>
