    <note>Chen(1) Bu [14418] In YLDD (Quanzhou Qingyuan zhi), 3151.34a-34b, there is a biography of a Quanzhou, Jinjiang county resident Chen(1) Feng (not in dataset), whose father was Fei [14422] (radical 187) and great grandfather was Bu. The other Chen(1) Feng [14420] (q.v.) was a Xinghua jun, Xianyou county resident, whose father was Ji(7) [14419] (radical 187), grandfather, Mai [22967], and great grandfather, Zao(3) [22966] (according to this scenario) was Bu's kin of the same generation with a different radical from Bu. Zao did not hold office, but Mai did. Since Mai does not appear on the degree lists, he must have had office-holding kin. According to the Qingyuan zhi, the Jinjiang Chen(1) Feng's younger brother Deng [14426] was a jinshi, but Fujian TZ, 148.37a has Deng as a son of Xianyou county Chen(1) Bian [14424] (radical 187), who was the brother of the Xianyou county Feng's father, Ji(7). My guess is that Deng was a younger cousin and the 'cong' character was dropped (not unusual) in the Qingyuan zhi text. In any case, the probability that two completely separate lineages living in contiguous counties would have exactly the same generational indicators in chronologically simultaneous generations is extremely remote. I am assuming that the lineage segmented during the generation of Bu and Zao and that one or the other moved--I take Xianyou county Zao as a cousin of Bu, who moved from Jinjiang to Xianyou. It might also be noted that Ji(7) was a close friend of both Zhang(1) Du [14514] and Li(2) Bing [8082], both Quanzhou, Jinjiang county residents.</note>
