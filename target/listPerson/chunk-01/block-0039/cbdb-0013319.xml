    <note>Zhai(2) Fangjin [13319] The reconstruction and linkage of the separate branches of this lineage is argued as follows: Shouxu [13321] and Shousu [13326] have the same generational names and both are Jizhou residents. According to Wang Yucheng, WJ, 29.1a-5b, Shousu's ancestor was Zhai(2) Fangjin, who was a chengxiang during the former Han (Renming Da cidian, p. 1369)--a Shangcai resident and therefore a Runan Zhai(2). Shousu was buried in Kaifeng and Tao [3841] moved from Kaifeng to Zhenjiang as did the ancestors of Qizong [13323] (who moved from Jizhou), ancestral home of Shouxu. Moreover, Qizong's father (estimated as active in 1196) has the same generational name as Zhai(2) Ruwen [8128]), who was active in 1135, which would be consistent with the hypothesis that Shousu represented a senior and Shouxu a cadet branch of the lineage. I am therefore making Fangjin and Shousu jia 'a,' Shouxu and his descendants (including Qizong) as branch 'b,' and Tao and his decendants as branch 'c,' with Fangjin being the lineal ancestor of Shouxu's father Lingtu [13320] and lineal ancestor of Shousu, and Shousu being lineage (second) granduncle of Tao. See separate documentation for various descendants.</note>
