    <note>Zhan(1) A [13337] He is a hypothetical common ancestor for the two branches of the Suian Zhan. According to Wang(1) Zao's [11625] funerary inscription for Taihe [167], his elder brother (tongnian you w/Zao in 1103) was Zhi [13339] (Zhi's father was An [13338] and Taihe's father was listed as Shi, therefore possibly cousins. However, An, as xiang xiansheng, educated four sons, all of whom earned the jinshi. Zhi (jinshi in 1103), Yu [171] and Cheng [13340] (jinshi in 1124) make three, and Taihe (jinshi in 1118) would make the logical fourth. Taihe may be an adopted son of Shi). I am assuming that these are four brothers and Taihe is adopted son of Shi (not, however, entered into the dataset or AGNATE file). This, in conjunction with similarity in generational names of Taihe and Dafang [168] and common generational names of all the sons of Zhi, Dafang and Taihe all point to a kinship link between Liangchen's [3117] lineage and Zhi's lineage.</note>
