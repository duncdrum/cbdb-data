    <note>Chen(1) Houling [14035] See Chen(1) Liang's [3075] funerary inscription for his grandfather Yi(3) [14041] (WJ, 27.1a-1b) and genealogies in Zhou Jiayou, 5.615-632 and XTS, 71B.28a-28b. Houling was preserved in the genealogies through oral transmission (different characters are used for the mingzi, which have the same pronunciation). According to Liang, from this time until his 8th and 7th generation ancestors Tong(2) [14036] and Long(2) [14037], this branch of the Chen became scattered among the common people (min). Tong(2) and Long(2) apparently established a set family home with a burial ground and Long(2)'s grandson Yuan(4) [14038] made his family branch of the lineage great (da qi jia). His third son, He(2) [14039], died young after producing a single heir, Zhiyuan(3) [14040], who entered the army as an officer during the Xuanhe period (1119-25) and died in uniform. His son, and Liang's grandfather, Yi(3), attempted both the exams and a military career and failed in both endeavors and ended his life a drunkard (?).</note>
