    <note>Shiqi(1) Zhen [14067] According to Ge(2) Shengzhong's [7263] funerary inscriptions for his descendants, Wei [14071] and Hong [14073] (q.v.), the Shiqi were originally descended from a Former Han dynasty Guangye, who was granted the surname Shi (food) and his descendant, who served Han Wudi as Shizhong was granted the surname Shiqi, based on the title of his office. The Shiqi were a hereditary military lineage until Zhen's son, Xian [14069] (two mingzi that are homophones), who was the first to learn classicism (ruxue), and his brother, Shu [14068], who studied for a degree and after failure entered the military service through his father's yin. Shu probably moved to Kaifeng (he ended his career in the military service as Tiju zaijing chusi kuwu) and is the father of Pu [16009] and great grandfather-in-law of Zhao(1) Shijun [16012]. Therefore, on the basis of generational names, chronological logic, occupation and address, I am treating Mian [16007] (a Suzhou resident) as Xian's nephew and a member of branch 'c' of the lineage estalbished by Xian when he moved to Suzhou, Yu [16008], a Jiangning jinshi, as Zhen's great grandson and as continuation of the root branch ('a') of the lineage that remained in Jiangning and Pian [16010], father-in-law of Zhao(1) Shijun, as a grandson of Shu and a member of the branch ('b') of the lineage that moved to Kaifeng.</note>
