    <note>Ji(6) Shen [24448] This unidentified son-in-law of Fang(1) Dao [3302] has an unusual surname, with only Sichuan residents cited in CBD. A Ji(6) Pengmin [24449], however, is a Jiaxing, Chongde county jinshi in 1208. Since Fang(1) Dao's father-in-law was Chang(2) Tong [7001], who moved from Kaifeng to Jiaxing, Haiyan county and one of Fang(1) Dao's grandsons-in-law, Li(2) Jingpan [24450] (identified as a jinshi), has the same generational name as Jiaxing 1231 university degree-holder, Li(2) Jingmian [24451], I am identifying Ji(6) Shen as Pengmian's father, and Li(2) Jingpan as Jingmian's brother. Since another of Fang(1) Dao's grandsons-in-law, Shi(5) Wenqing [17113], was a Mingzhou, Yinxian resident, and Dao, himself, settled in Hangxian, these identifications make both geographical and chronological sense. The Ji(6) may very well represent one lineage in the generation elite exodus from Sichuan at the end of the 12th and during the first half of the 13th century.</note>
