    <note>Fang(2) Qian [17131] At the beginning of the Tsin, he was sent as an ambassador to the Northern Barbarian, where he was detained. Since the barbarian used the character Wu for Fang(2), the surname was changed to Fangyin until the family (I date with Lun [17132]) moved South with the establishment of the Northern Wei and settled in Henan (I identify county as Luoyang, address of descendant, Rong [17136]) and changed the surname back to Fang(2). See XTS, 71B.56a and Zhou Jiayou, 4.466-7. I am also assuming that the Song Fang(2) descend from this branch of the lineage based solely on 1) family illustrious during Tang cited by Lou(2) Yue [3624] in funerary inscription for Yuwen(1) Shizhong's [2101] wife, born Fang(2)--if branch 'a' one would expect some reference to pre-Tang distinction, and 2) affinal ties over a multigenerational period with the Henan Yuwen(1). I trace both branches of the Fang(2) lineage back to Ya [17117] based on 1) a shared Qinghe address and 2) the shared generational names of Yanqian [17129] and his son Xuanling [17130] (branch 'a') and Yanyun [17135] and his son #1 Xuanjing [17138] (branch 'b') at beginning of Tang, which suggests a belief, true or not, of a common ancestor.</note>
