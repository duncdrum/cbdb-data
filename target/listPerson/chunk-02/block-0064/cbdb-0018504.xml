    <note>Huang(2) F [18504] The Huang(2) of this lineage lived near the border between Nankang, Duchang county and Jiangzhou, Hukou county and the exact address of any member of the lineage at any point in time is not clear. What does seem to be true is that 1) the Hukou and Duchang Huang(2) considered themselves members of the same lineage (Cao Yanyue, WJ, 18.1a), 2) the branch of the lineage represented by Hao(2) [18508] and his son Hang [18509] (q.v.) were probably members of the Duchang root lineage although Hao(2) is also listed as a Xingzi county resident and Xipo [18505], a jinshi in 1053, is listed as a Hukou resident. Since Hao(2) was called the Xipo xiansheng, I am assuming that Huang(2) Xipo was a direct ancestor and, based on chronological logic, Hao(2)'s great grandfather. I am going to treat Hao(2)'s branch of the lineage as jia 'a' and as Duchang residents. I have created Huang(2) F in order to link the two since we can trace the ancestry of jia 'b' to an earlier identified person than we can jia 'a.' Therefore, Huang(2) F will serve as the lineage uncle of Shaqi [10851] (earliest identified member of the Hukou county jia) and as the great grandfather of Xipo, earliest identified member of jia 'a.'</note>
