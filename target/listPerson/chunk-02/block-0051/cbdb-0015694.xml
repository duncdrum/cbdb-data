    <note>Cheng(1) Xin [15694] According to Ouyang(1) Xiu's [1384] funerary inscription for his great grandson, Lin [118], the Cheng, from QinHan on, lived in various places and became illustrious lineages (zhuxing) in each locality and their descendants used it as a basis to maintain their status. Xin is the elder lineage cousin of Yu(5) [15695], great grandfather of Xiang [3103] (father of Hao [3102] and Yi [3105]), who moved from Shenzhou, Shenxian to Kaifeng. Shenxian (earlier name was Xiabo) was a neighboring county to Boye and both were a part of Zhongshan jun during earlier dynasties. According to Ouyang(1) Xiu, they moved here and established the Zhongshan branch during Tang, probably from the root Guangping Cheng lineage, also situated in Hebei. Since Xiang's great grandfather, Yu(5), was the first to gain office and his son, Xizhen [15698], was buried in Honan, which then became the family benguan and Lin's father, Yuanbo [15697], was the first of this branch to hold office, the move of Lin to Luoyang was associated with the earlier migration of the cadet branch of the lineage. But the early demise of Xiang's father, Yu(6) [11699], placed his branch of the lineage in financial straits and Lin's success placed him in a position to aid his kin (see other documentation). The history of this lineage strengthens the general hypothesis that the cadet branches migrated and pursued political careers, whereas the root lineages remained in the ancestoral home and remained aloof from public office as senior members of the local elite.</note>
