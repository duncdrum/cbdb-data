    <note>Ding(1) Hao [21625] The marriage between Dou Cheng's [8129] daughter and Hao's son, Ding Wei [1641], was arranged when Hao and Cheng held office together in Jingzhou, Northwest China, and when Wei was still a young man, not more than 20 given Cheng's death in 982, and probably much younger. Therefore, Wei actually spent very little time in Suzhou. According to the Song Shi biography of Cheng, Cheng had foresight into the future greatness of his son-in-law; closer to the truth may be that Wei's grandfather moved from Jizhou (Liao territory) to Suzhou and Cheng's father moved from the same place to Luoyang. In other words, the Ding and Dou may have been members of the same kindred group long before this marriage. Wei and his brothers all had the same generational indicator in their mingzi (radical 149) as did the sons of Dou Cheng's brothers. SS, 263.14a-14b.</note>
