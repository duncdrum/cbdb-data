    <note>Ding(1) Hui [21616] Great grandson was Baochen [21619] (q.v.). According to Hu Su's funerary inscription for Baochen's brother, Zongchen [21620], their grandfather's mingzi was Nijing (not in dataset) and, whereas Baochen's grandfather is identified as Liang [21617], Hu Su identifies Zongchen's grandfather as Hengbi (not in dataset). There is no doubt about Baochen and Zongchen being brothers, so the only conclusion is either that one or the other became an adopted son of a lineage uncle or that the funerary inscriptions of one or the other uses zi rather than mingzi for ancestry. Zongchen's father is not identified by name, but has a posthumous title as does Baochen's father, Jianzhi [21618]. Otherwise, the occupational history is the same, so that use of Baochen's ancestry for both brothers will not affect any conclusions drawn from the dataset.</note>
