    <note>Xu(1) Yi [20601] Ouyang(1) Xiu [1384] traces ancestry back to a State of Jin official during Chunqiu times, Tong (not in dataset), but says that the genealogies were lost after Tong and there was no way to trace the line of descent until Yi. Yi was executive censor at the time of empress Wu and because of his criticisms he was exiled to Linchuan, thereby becoming the ancestor of the Yihuang Xu(1) [Hymes does not include this documentation]. His descendant, Zhiyao(zi)'s [20604] (q.v.) mingzi is not given in his funerary inscription, nor any name for father and grandfather, both of whom served in the Southern Tang administration. Zhiyao(zi)'s father moved to Luzhou, Hefei at the end of Five Dynasties because of the decline of Southern Tang, but Zhiyao(zi)'s son, Hang [20598], is still listed as a Yihuang jinshi with the same generational name as Zhenglun's [20594] nephew, Ji [20592]. There can be no doubt about the identification of the Yihuang Xu(1) with the lineage, whose ancestor was Yi. Ouyang Xiu, WJ, 61.6b-7b.</note>
