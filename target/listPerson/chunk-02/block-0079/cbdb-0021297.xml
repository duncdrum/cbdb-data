    <note>Chen(1) Dayou(2) [21297] Liu(2) Zai [11800], in his funerary inscription for descendant, Chen(1) Jiayan [21309], identifies Dayou(2) as a uncle (bofu) of Shengzhi. Liu(2) Zai also suggests a commmon ancestry with Yaosou [97] and Yaozi [99], through an ancestor, Fahui [21305], who once held office as prefect of Fuzhou and whose son, Sheng(4) [21306], moved to Jianning. XTS, 71B.30a lists Fahui, but no sons. Fahui was the only son of Boxin [21304], #6 son of Chen(1) Qian(4) [21300], 2nd emperor of the Chen dynasty, who reigned between 559 and 566. Fahui is identified by Liu(2) Zai as the 11th generation ancestor of Jiayan (fl. 1183), which would make Fahui active in ca. 883 by my count, which makes sense as far as descendants are concerned, but not as far as ancestry. Since Fahui does not share a generational name with any other grandsons of Qian(4), my guess is that he was a descendant, whose generation was unknown, and placed under Boxin, who was a lineal ancestor. In other words, Liu(2) Zai is correct and the Tang genealogical tables are misleading. Fahui, then, may also probably a lineal ancestor of Chen(1) Xiang(6) [14225], the Yingchuan Chen, who moved from Bozhou to Sichuan, but this is not confirmed by any source for the Sichuan Chen(1).</note>
