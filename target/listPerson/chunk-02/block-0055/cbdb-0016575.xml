    <note>Zeng(1) Ketu [16575] Wang(2) Anshi [1762], in his funerary inscription drafted for Ketu's great grandson, Zhiyao [16579], traces ancestry to the rulers of the state of Zeng (w/radical 163), who dropped the radical 163 from their surname when Zeng was reduced. Zeng was located in the area of modern Yixian (a county, whose area was in the Song prefecture, Yi, but also bordering on Yan). This area was in the state of Lu during the time of Confucius. This would make ancestry Luguo. In addition, Zeng(1) Gong [7364], in his funerary inscription for his brother, Zai [16581] (q.v.) traces ancestry to Lu. However, a Zeng(1) Ju [16576] gave up his Marquis and migrated to avoid the disturbances of the Wang Mang inerregnum, and settled in Yuzhang (Hongzhou), Nanchang and later the lineage segemented and one branch settled in Nanfeng. I am going to identify the Song lineage as a Yuzhang Zhang to distinguish them from the direct descendants of Zengzi, a Luguo Zeng lineage.</note>
