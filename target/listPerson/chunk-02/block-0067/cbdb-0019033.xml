    <note>Huang(2) Rong [19033] Listed in Sanshan zhi, 31.31a as a Changde (Dingzhou [Hunan]) person who lived in Fuzhou, Yongfu (Yongtai) county and a lineage kin (benzu) of Kui [19029], Dounan [19028], Ding [14159], Shou [19032], Hong(2) [19031] and Shi(4) [19030]. Dounan, his sons Hong(2) and Shi(4) and Rong [19033] are all also recorded as Dingzhou, Wuling jinshi in Hunan TZ (references cited under respective entries). Since Ding is not listed in the Hunan TZ, there is no reason to suspect that the Hunanese were trying to claim a zhuangyuan and his family. The inescapable conclusion is that Dounan was a lineage uncle (not uncle) of Ding and Yong(2) [14161]; he moved to Yongtai after his lineage (third) nephew earned jinshi #1; subsequently received a facilitated degree and then his sons Shi(4) and Hong(2), and nephew, Rong, who moved with him, earned the jinshi. Since Shou was not listed as a Dingzhou jinshi, he must also be a lineage nephew of Dounan from the original Yongtai branch. There are other Hunan Huang(2) lineages, whose members earn degrees before Dounan, including an Anlu Huang(2). Anlu county was the ancestral home of the Jiangxia Huang(2), who were the ancestors of both the Song Jiangxia Huang(2) of Fujian and the Dongyang Huang(2) of Xiushui (Huang Tingjian's [7111] lineage). Sanshan zhi, 31.31a; Fujian TZ, 149.36a; Hunan TZ, 134.20b.</note>
