    <note>Huang(2) Weidan [19040] Huang(2) Yu(10)'s [19048] (q.v.) funerary inscription says that his ancestor, Weidan, gave each of his five sons a classic and all earned degrees. According to Fujian TZ, 147.19a, Weidan, 10th generation ancestor of Shen [19042], taught his sons using the five classics and each earned degrees. Yu(10)'s funerary inscription says that Weidan moved from Gushi county to Shaowu, whereas the Fujian TZ does not mention a move. However, He(2) Dan's [12732] funerary inscription for Yongcun [19054] (q.v.), says that Weidan moved to Shaowu. There are no pre-Song Shaowu jinshi listed in the Fujian TZ. One of Weidan's sons, Zhiliang [19071], was the 6th generation ancestor of Yongcun's great grandfather, Jiong [19052], and, therefore, the 5th generation ancestor of Jiong's father, Mengchen [19051]. Zhiliang held office. I suspect that Weidan was related to Ying [12597] (ancestor of the other Shaowu Huang(2), who moved from Gushi to Shaowu), and that his kin--perhaps more than Ying and Zhiliang, moved to Shaowu. What is certain, is that this branch of the Shaowu Huang(2) were immigrants and that the move probably took place around 880. I maintain the two main Shaowu Huang(2) as separate lineages for the time being--it is strange that none of the three funerary inscriptions for Ying's descendants mention Weidan. I am identifying Zhiliang, Mengchen, etc. as jia 'a,' Shen and his brothers as members of jia 'b,' and Wenxun [19044], father of Deyu [19045] and great grandfather of Yu(10), as the first identified member of jia 'c' and as a 10th generation descendant of Weidan based on his estimated active years coinciding with those of Shen and his brothers. Of course, the generation may be quite different.</note>
