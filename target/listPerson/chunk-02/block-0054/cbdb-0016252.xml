    <note>Yang(2) Hongxin [16252] According to Ouyang(1) Xiu's [1384] funerary inscription for his great grandson, Qi(2) [16255], the lineage lived near the barbarian (hu) and therefore were learned in war and archery and were a hereditary military family (jiangjia, a term used to describe the background of several members of the family). I am identifying Qi(2)'s granduncle, Ye(2) [14257] (q.v.) (whose mingzi here is jiye, but he has all the right sons, all of whom Ouyang(1) Xiu identifies as great generals dajiang] etc.), as Hongxin's nephew. Hongxin's son, Zhongxun [16253], and grandson, Guangyi(2) [16254], were military commanders of Linzhou, which leads me to believe that they were the hereditary military governors of the area as were their affinal kin, the Zhe(1) of Fuzhou. A kinsman and Linzhou resident, Rong (not in dataset), received an award from Zhenzong because seven generations of the family still lived together (CBD, 4, 3130).</note>
