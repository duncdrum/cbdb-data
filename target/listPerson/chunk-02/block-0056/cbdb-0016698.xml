    <note>Zhu(1) Yuan(2) [16698] According to the funerary inscription of his elder cousin, Jiang (q.v.) [7201], Yuan(2) and his brother Jin (not in dataset) were orphaned at an early age and Jiang raised them as if they were his own sons. Jiang moved from Fuzhou to Suzhou and is listed as a jinshi from Houguan county in the Fujian TZ and as a Suzhou jinshi in Suzhou local histories. Yuan(2) is listed as a Suzhou jinshi in YLDD, 2368.7b as well as a Fuzhou, Fuqing county jinshi in Fujian TZ, 149.15b. Yuan(2) married a woman of the Changzhou Yao(1) and therefore moved his family (jia) there, according to Cai(1) Kan's [3860] funerary inscription for Jiang. I am moving Jiang from Houguan to Changzhou county and Yuan(2) from Changzhou county (Jiangnan TZ has him as a resident of Wuxian) to Changzhou, Wujin county. Yuan(2)'s zi is the same as the mingzi of Zhu(1) Xiyan [7203] and these two lineages may be related.</note>
