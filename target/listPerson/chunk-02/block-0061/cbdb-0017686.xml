    <note>Zhao(1) Xiyong [17686] The father of Yuyun [17688] (q.v.) is listed as Xiyan (not in dataset) in the imperial genealogies and Yuyun was his only son, whereas Yuyun had at least one elder brother named Yuying [17687] and Yuyun's funerary inscription and those of his sons have Yuyun's father as Xiyong (or, in one case a copiest error has it as Xicheng). I suspect that Xiyan was the eldest son of Shichui [17679], who probably died early and without heirs and that Xiyong was dropped along with his eldest son, Yuying, when the genealogical tables were copied. Both Yuyun and Yuying are listed as Wuzhou, Lanqi residents, but Yuyun's sons and grandsons are all listed as Huzhou residents. I am going to assume that Xiyong moved to Wuzhou and that Yuyun moved back to Huzhou.</note>
