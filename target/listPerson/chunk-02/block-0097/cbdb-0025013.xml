    <note>Yue(1) Zhou [25013] This was an interesting lineage. They were hereditary classicists (ruye) and Zhou's great grandson, Cai [25016] (q.v.) and probable great grandson, Gen [25017], both earned the juren degree and yet there are no Yue(1) jinshi listed in the Sichuan TZ for Song or Yuan. They were able to contract at least one very good marriage, Gen was father-in-law of Sun(1) Kan [3777], , which means that the Yue(1) had at least as high status as the Sun(1), who had affinal connections with Zhong(4) Shidao [8040], a chief minister of state. This suggests that empire-wide status and local status differed and that local status was decisive in marriages.</note>
