    <note>Xu(4) Ru [18641] Identified by Wang(2) Anshi [1762] in his genealogy of the Xu(4) (see ancestor, Yun [18628]), as a grandson of Yuan(2) [18640], but in Xinan zhi, Yuan(2), is identified as a fifth generation (6th generation by my count) ancestor of Ti [788], which would make Ru a great grandson of Yuan(2), which makes better chronological sense. Ru could not bear to live under the rule of the Later Liang, after fall of Tang, and moved to Jiangnan. The target of this migration and subsequent moves are not clear. Ru's grandson, Gui(2) [18643], is identified as a Qimen resident, who temporarily set up residence on the border between Xixian and Xuancheng counties. His eldest son, Sui(2) [18644], is identified as a Qimen resident, who moved to Xuancheng. Son #2, Ti, is identified by one source as a Qimen resident and, in others, as a Xixian resident. Son #3, Jiong [18645], is identified as a Xixian resident. Sui(2)'s son, Yu(2) [18649], is listed as a Yixian jinshi, but he is also cited in the Xuancheng zhi. Ti's sons are all identified as living in Xuancheng. I am going to assume that Ru's grandson, Gui(2), moved from Xixian to Qimen, and his eldest son, Sui(2), from Qimen to Xuancheng along with his younger brothers, who will all be identified as Xuancheng residents. It is likely, however, that some members of the lineage moved to Kaifeng. Yu(2)'s two sons, both of whom supposedly earned the degree, appear on no jinshi list. See also documentation for ancestor, Yun.</note>
