    <note>Zhou(1) Guo [23312] See documentation in 1148 jinshi list, sijia #38, for great grandson [23315], Rushi. Rushi's mother was Guo(3), also a prominent Shengxian family--the first jinshi was Guo(3) Wenhuan [26974] in 1205 (Kuaiji xu, 6.13a) followed by a Bicai [26976] in 1220 (ibid., 6.14a) and by Wenhuan's nephew, Zhengji [26975], in 1238 (ibid., 6.15b). These Guo(3) are almost certainly members of the same lineage as the Son-in-law, Guo(3) E [26972], and grandson-in-law, Guo(3) Sui [26976], of Zhou(1) Guo's son, Yu(5) [23313] (q.v.). Another prominent Shengxian family, the Ru(1), were intermarried with the Zhou(1). Ru(1) Xiang [23923], who earned the degree in 1148 (wujia #82) was married to a Zhou(1). The first Ru(1) jinshi was Yue [23919], who earned the degree in 1042 (ibid., 6.3a). There were five other Shengxian Ru(1) jinshi after Yue, with last recorded Ru(1) jinshi in 1211 (some of the Shengxian Ru(1) jinshi are only recorded in Yanlu, 1.20b-21a and not in Kuaiji xu). The pattern is strange if degree-holding, alone, established high status. Since the Zhou(1) married daughters of Guo(3)--before they began earning the jinshi--and the Ru(1) married Zhou(1) daughters, even though they were a prominent degree-holding family long before the Zhou(1). Between 1042 and 1223, there were 33 Shengxian jinshi--the Zhou(1), Guo(3) and Ru(1) accounted for 14 of them! What was the mobility pattern or were these families a kindred group of roughly the same status, whether they earned degrees or not?</note>
