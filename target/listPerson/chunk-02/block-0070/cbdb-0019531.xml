    <note>Leng(1) Min [19531] There are two branches of the Nanchang Leng, 'a,' whose residence was Fenning (modern Xiushui) county and 'b,' whose residence was located in Wuning county. Since they share generational names in common during some generations recorded in the Nanchang lists, I assume that they derive from a common root lineage. There are many juren from both counties as well as those who received posthumous titles on the basis of the merit of their descendants. After Min, the first Nanchang Leng jinshi, I only include those jinshi or juren, who are documented as kin or whose generational names were shared by both branches of the lineage--e.g. Ying+x, water and/or fire radical as generational indicator. I suspect that the two Suzhou, Changshu county Leng, who received the jinshi in 1148 are related, but there is no documentary evidence to support this hypothesis and neither man is included in the dataset, as yet.
