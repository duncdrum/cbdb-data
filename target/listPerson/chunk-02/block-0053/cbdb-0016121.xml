    <note>Jiang(3) Xu [16121] According to Wang(1) Zao [11625], WJ, 27.26a, there was a Jiang(3) whose merit earned him an enfeoffment as a marquis of the region, which later became Changzhou, Yixing county. XTS, 75B.19b has a Jiang(3) Xu, who was active during Wang Mang's Xin dynasty (Xu refused to serve and used illness as an excuse to retire [Renming Da cidian, p. 1541]) and designates a tenth generation descendant, Xiu [16126], as the one who moved to Yixing. Zhang(1) Shou(3) [8017], in his funerary inscription for Jiang(3) Yuan [16192] (q.v.), identifies a Jiang(3) Zheng [16191] as a Han official who controlled Kuaiji Jun and ancestor of Yuan and Zheng's younger brother, Cheng [16124], as the marquis whose descendants lived in Yixing and included Jiang(3) Tang [465] and Jiang(3) Zhiji [461]. I am treating Zheng and Cheng as sons of Xu. XTS, 75B.19a also establishes only membership in same zu as the link between Xu's direct descendants and the lineage of Tang zaixiang, Shen [16130]. A Jiang(3) Zhen(2) [16132], from Yixing, who seems to hold zaixiang level offices, is not included in the genealogical tables of XTS, even though he was also a Yixing resident. Zhen(2) is identified as father of Lie [16133], a Changzhou, Yixing jinshi. I am assuming that the Yixing Jiang(3) all descend from Xu and that Xu's sons, Jiang(3) Zheng and Cheng, Zheng being the first member of the lineage who moved to Yixing in 25 A.D., and that Xiu moved in 325. I am making zaixiang Shen's grandfather, Jiangming [16127], as a lineal descendant of Xiu and his other immediate relatives as members of jia 'c.' The Tang officials, Zhen(2) (who holds zaixiang type titles) and his elder brother, Jian [16131], grandfather Zishen 16125] and sons, Lie and Huan [16134], as lineal descendants of Jiang(3) B and members of jia 'b.' Zishen is identified as great grandfather of the Tang jinshi, Lie, and Huan and Lie as son of Zhen(2). Jiang(3) Tang and his immediate ancestors are identified as lineal descendants of Jiang(3) B members of jia 'a.' Jiang(3) Jizhou's [3232] (q.v.) ancestors descended from Xu and his son, Xiu, and were members of the same patrilineal kinship group as Shen, Tang, Zhiji, etc. This lineage is a good example of the dispersion of a kinship group and includes the Yongjia, Suzhou, Fenghua, Xianju as well as other Zhejiang and Southern Jiangsu branches of the lineage (e.g. Linhai, Yinxian, Hangxian) not yet recorded probable branches of the lineage. The Song Zhejiang Jiang were also possibly kin with Chiang Kaishek's (not in dataset) ancestors.</note>
