    <note>Liu(2) Shuxiang [17662] According to Chen(1) Liang [3075], "In 1162, I had been temporarily living in Linan for three years and my father and mother wanted me to marry and ordered me to return. Yiwu county resident He(2) Maogong (He(2) Ke [17659]) wanted to arrange for me to marry his elder brother's daughter. However, the He(2) family were spoken of as among the richest families in Yiwu and Maogong and his brother had already become able writers and Maogong's fame was especially great. I was poor and very fearful that it was not able to be done (or not appropriate?). In general, the members of Maogong's kindred group (yindang) all considered it to be not right (buran). Only Wuyi Liu(2) Shuxiang strongly assisted in explantion (?) and spoke to my father, who quickly sent the bride price. And in the next year, 1163, the marriage took place and the kindred group all attended (zai). This translation should be rechecked, but great stuff. Shuxiang was He(2) Ju(2)'s [17658] son-in-law and He(2) Ke's brother-in-law. He was also probably related to the Wuyi Liu lineage of Liu(2) Bangguang [20447] (q.v.), who was a son-in-law of imperial clansman, Zhao(1) Shifen [20443]. Chen Liang, WJ, 30.3b-4b.</note>
