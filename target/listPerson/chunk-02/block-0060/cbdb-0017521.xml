    <note>Yu(1) Yue [17521] Wuxing zhi, 17.15b; Zhejiang TZ. 125.24b. There was a Yu(1) Hao [22814], who received the jinshi in 1193, who moved from Hangzhou, Yuhang county to Wuxing and who has the same generational name as the grandnephews of Si [2089]. Wuxing zhi, 17.17a identifies Hao's elder brothers as Pingyi [24458] and Xiyin [24459], both 1163 Yuhang jinshi (Zhejiang TZ, 125.24a), nephew, Yingfu [22827] (whose grandson, Lifu (not in dataset), has the same generational indicator as Yue's great grandfather and great granduncle!), a Yuhang jinshi in 1184 (Zhejiang TZ, 126.9a [also listed as a Guian jinshi]), nephew, Yu(1) Yuan [16292] and Yu(1) Jian [16293], both Jiaxing jinshi in 1184 (Zhejiang TZ, 126.9a) as well as their father, Guangning [16291], an 1148 jinshi, who is listed in Wuxing zhi, 17.17a as Hao's elder brother. Guangning's father, grandfather, and great grandfather have no generational names in common with the immediate ancestors of Yue and his granduncle Si. However, my guess is that they are members of a common root lineage in which one son of Yu [22812], Chou(2) [22813] (sixth generation ancestor of Hao), moved to Hangzhou and a (unnamed) member of a collateral and cadet branch of the lineage  moved to Huzhou. However, for the present I am treating them as two separate lineages.</note>
