    <note>Lv Shiyu [17489] He was a modestly wealthy gentry of Yongkang, who was still not extremely rich when he married Xia Chen's daughter in ca. 1155. She was the elder lineage cousin of Shiyu's first wife. She was his helpmate as he accumulated several thousand mou of farmland and became extremely rich (according to Chen Liang; according to Ye Shi he was a very able manager of sericulture and agriculture). In fact, Xia Chen's daughter's first son, Hao (who had a different generational indicator for his mingzi as did her second son, Yuan, from Shiyu's first son, Yue), was given office as a result of Shiyu's contribution of relief grain. Shiyu educated his sons (according to Ye Shi, his sons and grandsons were all classicists [ru]) and Hao became juren in Chunxi period and the son-in-law of Guan Jian, grandson of the state coucil member, Guan Shiren. Hao's mother-in-law was a member of the imperial clan. The first Yongkang Lu jinshi were Fu in 1238 (Zhejiang TZ, 128.3b) and Gui in 1253 (ibid., 128.19b), neither of whom can be linked with this lineage. There are no Yongkang Xia jinshi. The rise of this branch of the indigenous Wuzhou Lu, as well as that of the Dongyang Lu, may have something to do with the arrival of the distinguished North China Dongping Lu (e.g. Lu Zuqian) in Jinhua. This collective biography, however, provides an excellent example of the interconnections between, and mobility of, local gentry lineages. The fact that Shiyu's second wife married him at age 27 and that she was one year older than him suggests that Lu Shiyu was marrying up. Ye Shi, WJ, 14.266-7; Chen Liang, WJ, 30.6a-7a (wife, n Xia, who married him at age 27 and died in 1192 at age 64). CBD, 2, 1216.</note>
