        <note>"C. Atwood note:Should be Che'üdei, which some identify with Je'üriyedei (also attested as Je’üredei). But this seems unlikely on phonological grounds (Cleaves did not make that association in his article on the Baljuna covenant).  YS 132/3210  has 徹里臺; is the 里 an lapsus for 兀, or could it be added? The latter could make it徹兀里臺, which could Che’üridei, closer to Je’üredei , but simple lapsus seems to be more probable, since 徹兀里臺  is not actually attested. Whether this is a semuren or a Mongol surname appears very uncertain. The person with the name is Maili, which could be from Melik, which would indicate a Semuren. But he “led the徹里臺tribe” in 1203 which should indicate his group was as a whole present on the Mongolian plateau before the conquest."</note>
